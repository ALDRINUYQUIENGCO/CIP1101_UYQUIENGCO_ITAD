        And also there is always a limit<sup>2</sup>.

        You're grounded for 1 week<sup>5</sup>.
        You cannot go outisde and also can't play with friends<sup>6</sup>.

        When the school starts he was nervous because it was his first day on high school<sup>11</sup>.
        He doesn't know his classmates and he was nervous because he luckily get into the highest section<sup>12</sup>.
        It makes him shy because his <dfn>"ate"</dfn> and <dfn>"kuya"</dfn> was popular in that school because 
        of academic exellence<sup>13</sup>.
        Aldrin is so lazy and don't really like school<sup>14</sup>.
        But it motivates him to study hard when he saw a beautiful girl in the room<sup>15</sup>.

        girl was an honor student<sup>16</sup>.
        Unfortunately, when Aldrin asked his <dfn>lolo</dfn> about this girl<sup>17</sup>.
        His <i>Lolo</i> said that this girl is your cousin<sup>18</sup>.
        And it makes him very sad and disappointed<sup>19</sup>.
        Like <em><q>from all the girls in the room why her?</q></em><sup>20</sup>.
        Camping month starts and Aldrin is still sad until he saw something<sup>21</sup>.
        A cute girl from another school so cute that it melts him head to toe<sup>22</sup>.
        Aldrin volunteers in the camping events to impress her<sup>23</sup>.
        He saw her smile at him at it makes him blush<sup>24</sup>.

    <p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
       College Life is so challenging<sup>1</sup>.
       Because it is the year that you will learn more about life<sup>2</sup>.
       It is the year that you became more aware of your surroundings<sup>3</sup>.
       More aware of the people arounds you<sup>4</sup>.
       And also it is the time that you will develop more about yourself and experience sadness and joy along the way<sup>5</sup>.
       But still having friends and families around you makes your life meaningful<sup>6</sup>.
       It gives you motivation to continue to do your passion and what you love doing in your life<sup>7</sup>.
       Aldrin's College life was a normal college life <sup>8</sup>.
       They drink play games with his friends and study at the same time <sup>9</sup>.
       Until the pandemic hits the wolrd <sup>10</sup>.
       The college life became boring for him <sup>11</sup>.
       Because having this <strong><abbr title="Corona Virus Disease - 2019">COVID-19</abbr></strong> makes us to 
       forcely do the online class <sup>12</sup>.
       He stopped going to school in 1 year <sup>13</sup>.
       Because he thought that it will end on 2022 <sup>14</sup>.
       But still many cases of this virus go up and we still do online class, so He decided to enroll for this year <sup>15</sup>. 
       This pandemic makes him realized that health is waelth <sup>16</sup>.
       So he decided to do some exercise everyweek <sup>17</sup>. 
       After many weeks he bought a bike and enjoy it with his cousins <sup>18</sup>.
       He start to feel the joy again just like a kid eating a dirt and laugh at it topgether with his friends <sup>19</sup>.
       Aldrin realized something about him and about life<sup>20</sup>.
       He learned to love himself and continue discovering more about it and realizig what is really worth it in life <sup>21</sup>.
       In College Years, Aldrin realized that the things that makes him sad along the way when he was born was just a path to 
       make him strogner until now<sup>22</sup>.
       And it makes him realized that we should cherish all the things that we have, all the persons that we love and 
       have care for us,
       because that was the greatest treasure in life<sup>23</sup>.
