    <h2 class="scuba">SCUBA DIVING</h2>
	<a href="BucketImage/scubaDiving.jpg" target="newPage"><img src="BucketImage/scubaDiving.jpg" class="scuba"></a>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scuba Diving is one og the thing I want to do in my life. I want to go to the ocean deep and see the sea creatures with my 
        own eyes. I also want to know the feeling of swimming with the fishes under the ocean. All of those things are all visible
    on my TV and I want to experience it so bad.

    <div id="B2">
        <h2 class="sky">SKY DIVING</h2>
        <a href="BucketImage/skyDiving.jpg" target="newPage"><img src="BucketImage/skyDiving.jpg" class="sky"></a>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am afraid of heights and I want to face it by doing this Sky Diving experience. Some of my friends
            experience it and they say that it was scary at first because all you can see are clouds but when you jump and you air in the air
            you can now know the feeling on what it is on the air like the birds in the sky. They say it was exciting and they want to try it
            again someday. So it makes me feel that I want to try it someday because just like how they tell their stories about it, I found
            it exciting and also cool.

        <a href="BucketImage/tatoo.jpg" target="newPage"><img src="BucketImage/tatoo.jpg" class="tattoo"></a>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to have a tattoo someday that has meaning in my life or something that when I see the
            Tatto art it will remind me of something or motivates me on something.
