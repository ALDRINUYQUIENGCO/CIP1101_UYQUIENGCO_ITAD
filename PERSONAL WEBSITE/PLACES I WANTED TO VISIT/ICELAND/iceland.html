            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thingvellir is one of Iceland's two UNESCO sites and one of the most consistently popular 
            tourist destinations in the country. You could spend hours hiking and horseback riding through the national park on your 
            own, but we suggest booking a snorkeling or diving excursion to swim the Silfra fissure—a slowly widening rift between the 
            Eurasian and North American tectonic plates.

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vatnajökull is a typical temperate ice cap composed of ice domes and numerous outlet glaciers, 
            some of which surge at irregular intervals. Vatnajökull ice cap is ca. 7700 km2 (and covers ca 8% of Iceland) and is still 
            Europe's largest ice cap by volume, although it has lost more than 15% of its volume during the last century. It conceals 
            seven active central volcanoes, valleys and glacial troughs.

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reynisfjara is a world-famous black-sand beach found on the South Coast of Iceland, just beside 
            the small fishing village of Vík í Mýrdal. Visits to it are included on many South Coast Tours, including this 6-Day Summer 
            Vacation Package.
