    <h2>Sénanque Abbey, Provence</h2>
        <img src="lavander.jpg" height="250px" width="350px"><p class="p1">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seemingly endless stretches of lavender make Provence one of the prettiest 
            (and best-smelling) places in France. One of the most scenic spots to enjoy the flower fields is Sénanque Abbey, 
            a 12th-century church near the village of Gordes. The gentle heather-gray color of the abbey looks custom-made for 
            its surroundings, particularly in June and July when the acres around it bloom into a sea of purple.

    <h2>Paris</h2>
    <img src="paris.jpg" height="250px"  width="350px"><p class="p2">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yep, the whole darn city. There's a reason the word flaner can't be translated perfectly 
            into English—the idea of a long, aimless stroll taken simply to soak up the scenery seems utterly French. And in Paris, 
            there's always something to stroll past. Walk the Promenade Plantee, considered the world's first elevated park, stock 
            up on cheese and wine for a picnic in Luxembourg Gardens, and end the day watching the sun set behind the Eiffel Tower.

    <h2>Gardens of Marqueyssac, Dordogne</h2>
    <img src="garden.jpg" height="250px"  width="350px"><p class="p3">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The famous Gardens of Marqueyssac make up one of the most stunning landscapes in France—and 
            the world. The 150,000 bubbly boxwood trees and hedges wrap around a 17th-century chateau that overlooks the Dordogne Valley. 
            The entire vista looks like an illustration from a Perrault fairytale.
