        <h2>Ostuni, Puglia</h2>
        <img src="Ostuni.jpg" height="250px" width="350px"><p class="p1">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ostuni is one of Puglia's most beautiful cities, a tumble of white-washed buildings 
            perched strategically atop a hill. It has views of the endless olive trees in the Valle d'Itria countryside and the 
            glimmering Adriatic Sea just 8 km away, home to some of the region's most exclusive resorts
        </p>

        <h2>Spiaggia delle Due Sorelle, Sirolo</h2>
        <img src="beach.jpg" height="250px"  width="350px"><p class="p2">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best beaches have always been those only accessible by boat and Spiaggia delle Due Sorelle 
            is no exception. Years of being overlooked in favor of the Cinque Terre and Amalfi Coast has left this strip of coastline 
            untouched and unspoiled. Pack a picnic—you won’t find anything else on this serene stretch of sand—and while away an hour or 
            two.

        <h2>Pantelleria</h2>
        <img src="Pantelleria.jpg" height="250px"  width="350px"><p class="p3">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ruggedly beautiful, Pantelleria has long been a favorite of in-the-know Italian society looking 
            for an escape to somewhere altogether more secluded. Offering a whole new spin on wellness, head up to Lago di Venere where 
            the warm waters form and volcanic mud form a natural spa at the heart of the island. Take a swim in the secluded coves that 
            surround the island before holing up at the impossibly-chic Sikelia in a getaway that is about as off-the-grid as it gets.
