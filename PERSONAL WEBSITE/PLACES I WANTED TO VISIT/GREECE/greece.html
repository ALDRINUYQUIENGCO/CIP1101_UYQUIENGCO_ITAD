		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Santorini Island is so spectacularly photogenic that even beginning photographers can capture 
		stunning images. In the charming village of Oia, cobalt-domed churches and whitewashed houses stand on slopes of the volcanic 
		island's caldera, which plunge into the mesmerizing deep blue waters of the Aegean Sea. Oia village is also famous for its 
		beautiful sunsets.

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Acropolis in Athens casts a spell of enchantment over modern-day viewers; its colossal ruins 
		evoke the glory of ancient civilization. Perched at the summit of the Acropolis hilltop, the Parthenon is a magnificent 
		classical-era temple that was the most sacred site of Greece in the 4th-century BC. A good vantage point for taking panoramic 
		photos is from Philopappou Hill, directly across from the Acropolis.

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The archaeological site of Delphi stands on the slopes of Mount Parnassus overlooking a valley 
		filled with olive groves. Delphi is designated as a UNESCO World Heritage site because of the importance of its 4th-century 
		BC pan-Hellenic sanctuaries. With vistas of mountains in the background, the ruins of the Temple of Athena look especially 
		splendid in photos.
