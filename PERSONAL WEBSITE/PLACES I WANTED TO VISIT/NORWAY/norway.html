            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Atlanterhavsveien, or commonly known as the Atlantic Road in English is a gorgeous and 
            impressive drive through one of the best places in Norway. Connecting the mainland of Norway with the pretty island of 
            Averøya, it's a great place to drive for the day. Make sure to visit Kvernes Stave Church, too. It's around 600-years old 
            and one of the oldest in the region.
