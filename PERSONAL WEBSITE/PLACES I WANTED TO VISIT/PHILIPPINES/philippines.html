        <img src="elNido.jpg" height="250px" width="350px"><p class="p1">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With its gorgeous rock formations, pristine beaches and clear aquamarine waters, El Nido 
            is a place that makes Filipinos beam with pride. Located on the northern tip of mainland Palawan, the municipality of El Nido 
            has been increasingly drawing tourists in year after year, with more travellers, both local and foreign, discovering its 
            undeniable beauty. The area is responsible in large part for why Palawan is recognized -and has been for some time - as the 
            best island in the world.

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TSoutheast of the island of Palawan, within the Sulu Sea, lies one of the best marine reserves 
            and dive sites in the world; the Tubbataha Reefs Natural Park. A sprawling system of coral reefs (containing about half of 
            the world's coral species) that is home to an extensive variety of fish, sharks, dolphins, and whale species, the Tubbataha 
            Reefs is one of the most sought-after waters for divers on the planet. For anyone interested in making the trip, the limited 
            three-month-long dive season runs from mid-March to mid-June and the only way to explore its spectacular waters is by visiting 
            on a live-aboard boat.

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pride of Bohol Province, the rolling landscapes of the Chocolate Hills were named after 
            their colour transition taking place between the wet and dry seasons when they grow a deeper and deeper shade of brown. Over 
            1,000 hills are estimated to be scattered across the 50sqkm (5,000ha) area.
