    <blockquote><p>
            I love writing <strong><em>"stories"</em></strong>, <strong><em>"poems"</em></strong> and also <strong></strong><em>"drawing"</em> 
            when I was a kid <sup>1</sup>.
            The favorite thing that I always do was drawing<sup>2</sup>. 
            Because that time I love watching <abbr title="Television">TV</abbr> and I draw my favorite catoon characters<sup>3</sup>. 
            There was a time that I joined <em>"poster making contest"</em> in grades school and I won 2nd place and it makes me happy<sup>4</sup>.
            Drawings and paintings gives me inspiration to push your limits<sup>5</sup>. 
            Because in drawings you can draw and imagine anything you want<sup>6</sup>.
            Another thing is I love solving math problems and playing puzzle games whe I was on high school<sup>7</sup>.
            I don't really know if it is a talent but for me I can consider it as a talent in me <sup>8</sup>.
            I joined <strong><em>"Math Techno Quiz"</em></strong> and I won <strong><em>"First place"</em></strong> in our school and 
            then I went to other school to compete <sup>9</sup>.
            I didn't get the first place to other school but I enjoyed it<sup>10</sup>.
            Because it gives me an experience to compete and also make friends <sup>11</sup>.
            I also do dancing when I was on high school <sup>12</sup>.
            It is fun to entertain the audience <sup>13</sup>.
            And also dancing makes our body healthy bacause it is also a some kind exercise <sup>14</sup>.
            Having a skills are cool and also fun <sup>15</sup>.
            And skills can also be obtained by practicing and trying it <sup>16</sup>.
            Not all can be good at something or instantly expert on it, we just sometimes need to push ourselves to do it<sup>17</sup>.
            Because <strong><q>you'll never know, unless you try it</q></strong> <sup>18</sup>.\
            Skill are everywhere, you just need to be creative and find it on your own<sup>19</sup>.
            So far, that's all the skill I have been explored on myself and I'm still exploring<sup>20</sup>.

            Everyday we do something just to get rid of our boredom <sup>1</sup>.
            We clean our house, get some walk with our dog and also gardening<sup>2</sup>.
            But me, my hobbies and what makes me happy are playing some <strong>computer games, drawing, dancing and also riding a bicycle</strong><sup>3</sup>.
            In computer we can talk and interact with other people around the world <sup>4</sup>.
            It is also cool because they made a game that can be played with other people <sup>5</sup>.
            It is fun because even if you and your friends are far to each other, you can still bond through the internet <sup>6</sup>.
            Some computer games are also challenging that makes you think critically <sup>7</sup>.
            In some time, I do draw when I had so much time interacting to gadgets <sup>8</sup>.
            Drawing something gives me a peace of mind and also happiness <sup>9</sup>.
            And the material I just need was a piece of paper and pencil<sup>10</sup>.
            I also do some outside activities to enjoy myself <sup>11</sup>.
            Like exercising outside using my bicycle <sup>12</sup>.\
            It gives me chill and time for myself when I'm riding a bicycle<sup>13</sup>.
            Because in our place, we are near in baywalk and the view was so relaxing and when you go to high places it's so worth it<sup>14</sup>.
            I do sometimes dance when I like the songs and also watch some dance tutorials to get some steps<sup>15</sup>.
            It is good to have hobbies in life<sup>16</sup>.
            It makes you feel alive and also inspired you to explore more about yourself on what makes you happy an enjoy<sup>17</sup>.
            For me the purpose of life was happiness<sup>18</sup>.
            And we are the one who will choose if we want to be happy or not<sup>19</sup>.
            We can find it everywhere, it could be a anything in this world, like a person, places or just some hobbies<sup>20</sup>.

    <blockquote><p>
           In life, we have different kinds of interest to make ourselves satisfied and happy<sup>1</sup>.
           Just like me, there are many things that interest me in<sup>2</sup>.
           Like playing games, traveling, reading books and watching some videos about aliens, animals, and on how to start a business<sup>3</sup>.
           It is so cool, because it makes me <strong>curious</strong> and it <strong>excites</strong>s me<sup>4</sup>.
           Reading and watching some clips on how to start business exccites me especially today<sup>5</sup>.
           Because I want to help my parents while I'm studying<sup>6</sup>.
           And yes, that's my interest too, on how to <strong>"earn money"</strong><sup>7</sup>.
           And also it excites me to learn on how to spend my money wisely<sup>8</sup>.
           There are games that can actually earn <strong>"real money"</strong> so I start researching about them<sup>9</sup>.
           After discovering that playing games can help me to earn money, it makes me it makes me happy<sup>10</sup>.
           Because I can now buy my own food with my own money and my parents don't need to worry about me in terms of allowance for today<sup>11</sup>.
           There are so many things that interest me up, and I am so happy that I give it a try<sup>12</sup>.
           Because it helps me to <strong>"grow"</strong> and <strong>learn new things</strong> in life<sup>13</sup>.
           And I always encourage myself that <strong><q>nothing is impossible if you really want something</q></strong><sup>14</sup>.
           I hope that someday I can achieve all the goals that I want with the help of the things that interest me today and for the future days<sup>15</sup>.
           Because sometimes, I fell down and don't have courage to do anything without knowing what the reason is<sup>16</sup>.
           But today I need to focus and balance all the things that I have like family,friends and school<sup>17</sup>.
           Because they are the ones who influence, inspired and makes me interested in our life<sup>18</sup>.
           I do love traveling, but the case is in order for us to travel we need money<sup>19</sup>.
           Maybe in the future I can do travel in different beach and mountains with my family and enjoy life<sup>20</sup>.
