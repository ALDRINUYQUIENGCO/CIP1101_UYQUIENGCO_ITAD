    <h1>SATURN</h1>
    <img src="saturn.jpg"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Saturn's</b> interior is most likely composed of a core of 
        ironâ€“nickel and rock (silicon and oxygen compounds). Its core is surrounded by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen, an 
        intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium, and finally, a gaseous outer layer. Saturn has a pale yellow 
        hue due to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere. An electrical current within the metallic hydrogen layer is thought 
        to give rise to Saturn's planetary magnetic field, which is weaker than Earth's, but which has a magnetic moment 580 times 
        that of Earth due to Saturn's larger size. Saturn's magnetic field strength is around one-twentieth of Jupiter's.[27] The 
        outer atmosphere is generally bland and lacking in contrast, although long-lived features can appear. Wind speeds on Saturn 
        can reach 1,800 km/h (1,100 mph; 500 m/s), higher than on Jupiter but not as high as on Neptune..</p>
